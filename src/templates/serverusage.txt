Development / Usage informations.

Flask internally requires that the HTML file(s) are located in a subdirectory "/templates/" relative to the server.py file.
Install Flask with "pip3 install Flask".
Start the program with "python3 server.py" and open localhost:5000 in any browser.

When the user has entered their query and checked all desired checkboxes they should click the button.
This button calls a JavaScript function which collects all necessary data and sends a GET request to the localserver.
This request can thus be accessed from python as a dictionary.

Our categories are yet to be named.             (lines 121 - 147 and 463 - 487)
The text at the end is yet to be inserted.      (line 519)

The result-table can easily be expanded should the need arise.
This result-table is automatically filled by Flask. Each entry consists of a list of three strings.
